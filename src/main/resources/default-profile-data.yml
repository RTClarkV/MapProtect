  ##                                Map State
  ##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ## map-state can be in 5 states: ACTIVE, IDLE, LOCKED, CLOSED, or JAILED.
  ## You can change the state in game with: /mpstate <map_name> <state>
  ## You can check the state of a map with: /mpstate <map_name>
  ## ACTIVE state: the map will run as usual with the given parameters.
  ## IDLE state: the map will do nothing as if it was not there, so careful using this state.
  ## LOCKED state: sets the area as if everything was false. Good for preventing further damage to an area quickly.
  ## CLOSED state: prevents players from entering the map or any outside interference. Useful for maintenance.
  ## JAILED state: prevents players from exiting the map. Players can still be teleported in or out.
