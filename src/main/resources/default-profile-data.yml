  ## map-state can be in 3 states: ACTIVE, IDLE or LOCKED.
  ## NOTE: the LOCKED state is currently not supported.
  ## ACTIVE state: the map will run as usual with the given parameters.
  ## IDLE state: the map will do nothing as if it was not there, so careful using this state.
  ## LOCKED state: Does not allow any player interactions, player entry, or block damage. Good for preventing further damage to an area quickly.
